## How to Run
You can access this Project by clicking on this <a href="https://hujianni.github.io/Horse-Racing-Simulation/" target="_blank">link</a>. 
When the page is loaded, you'll have 5 seconds to pick the horse you bet will win. After the 5 second countdown, the race will start and the horses will move at random speeds. Will the horse you bet on win the race? The result will be shown after the match finished and you'll know!

The experience will be the best when racing on a desktop.

- [ ] Make the titles fade in and out when changing texts.
- [ ] Add keydown eventlistener to have the racer start the game by pressing any key.
- [ ] Add sound effects for winning or losing.
- [ ] Refactor the code to make the horses added dynamically.
